# Farmers-Interactive-Website
The project deals with the interaction of Farmers with our website. Farmers are those part of society that has very least amount of interaction with technology around them. This project deals with creating a website to solve their agricultural problem and making a seamless interface for easy and efficient use. Nowadays, farmers are decreasing due to their losses in their farming. Day by day, the number of farmers is decreasing. This can be due to a lack of support. So this project aims to help them in every way possible. Solving the problem and making the website doesnâ€™t help them ultimately. Building a better interface important at the same time. Creating a better user experience for farmers is another essential part of my project.
